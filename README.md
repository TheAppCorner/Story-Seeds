# Story-Seeds

Story Seeds is a collaborative storytelling web app where users plant "story seeds" by writing the beginning of a narrative. Other users can pick up these seeds, continue the story, and create branching narratives. The app could feature an ever-expanding tree of interconnected stories, showcasing the creativity of the community.
